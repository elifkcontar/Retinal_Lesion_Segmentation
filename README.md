Abstractâ€”Diabetic retinopathy(DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness in working-age adults. DR causes abnormal retina patterns such as exudate, microaneurysm,and hemorrhage. Segmentation of retinal lesion is an imbalanced classification problem. Task includes both background-foreground imbalance and the imbalance between lesion classes. Additionally, lesion sizes varies in a large range. In this paper, we propose an instance based IoU loss function and two-stage model to solve these size and imbalance problems. IB IoU loss calculates IoU score for each instance separately to increase the effect of the small lesions whereas the two-stage model is proposed to decrease the background-foreground imbalance effect on training. Experiments show that, proposed method has performance improvement in small lesions.
